## Next Steps
After completing this, try setting up a CMS backend and attaching it to your Nuxt frontent. I recommend using [Strapi](https://strapi.io) or [Storyblok](https://storyblok.com). Note that strapi is open source and self hosted and storyblok is not.
- Check out [the nuxt pages documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/pages) for information on creating dynamic pages using async functions and a slug page.
- For this you will want to look into using either apollo or axios to connect the front to backend
